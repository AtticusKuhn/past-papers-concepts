# Project Brief: Past Paper Concept Analyzer

## 1. Core Goal

The primary goal of this project is to analyze past Cambridge Computer Science Tripos exam papers (provided as PDFs) to identify and extract common themes, key concepts, and recurring terms.

## 2. Key Objectives

-   **Ingest PDFs:** Process PDF files containing past exam papers and solutions.
-   **Extract Text:** Accurately extract the textual content from the PDFs.
-   **Identify Concepts:** Utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the text and identify key concepts, themes, and technical terms.
-   **Build Database:** Store the extracted concepts, terms, associated metadata (paper, year, question number), and citations in a structured database.
-   **Enable Analysis:** Provide a way to query or analyze the database to understand trends and commonalities across different papers and years.

## 3. Scope

-   **Input:** PDF files of past Cambridge Computer Science Tripos papers and solutions.
-   **Processing:** Text extraction, LLM-based concept/term identification.
-   **Output:** A structured database containing concepts, terms, and their citations.
-   **Analysis:** Basic querying or reporting capabilities to view trends.

## 4. Success Criteria

-   Successfully process a collection of PDF past papers.
-   Accurately extract key concepts and terms relevant to Computer Science topics covered in the Tripos.
-   Store extracted information in a queryable database with correct citations (paper, year).
-   Demonstrate the ability to identify recurring themes across multiple papers.
