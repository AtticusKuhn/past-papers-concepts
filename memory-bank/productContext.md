# Product Context: Past Paper Concept Analyzer

## 1. Problem Solved

Manually reviewing years of past exam papers to identify recurring themes, important concepts, and shifts in focus is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Students revising for exams, lecturers designing courses, or researchers studying curriculum evolution lack an efficient way to get a high-level, data-driven overview of the Cambridge Computer Science Tripos content over time.

## 2. Desired Outcome

This project aims to provide an automated system that:
- Ingests past papers (PDFs).
- Extracts key computer science concepts and terms using AI.
- Stores this information in a structured database with citations (paper, year, potentially question).
- Allows users to easily query and visualize the frequency and context of concepts across different years and papers.

## 3. User Experience Goals

- **Efficiency:** Significantly reduce the time needed to analyze past papers for trends.
- **Insight:** Reveal patterns and recurring topics that might not be obvious through manual review.
- **Accuracy:** Provide reliable extraction of concepts linked back to their source papers.
- **Accessibility:** Offer a straightforward way to access and explore the analyzed data.
