# Project Progress: Past Paper Concept Analyzer

## Current Status

**Phase**: Architecture and Planning

We have completed the initial architecture planning for the project. The project will follow a modular pipeline architecture with clear separation of concerns between PDF extraction, text processing, LLM analysis, and database storage.

## Completed Work

- [x] Defined project goals and success criteria
- [x] Established core architectural approach
- [x] Selected primary technologies for each component
- [x] Determined data flow through the system
- [x] Identified potential technical challenges
- [x] Added Nix support through shell.nix for NixOS compatibility

## In Progress

- [ ] Setting up basic project structure
- [ ] Creating proof-of-concept for PDF extraction
- [ ] Designing database schema
- [ ] Implementing initial LLM prompts

## Upcoming Work

- [ ] Build PDF ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Develop LLM concept extraction module
- [ ] Implement database storage layer
- [ ] Create basic query interface
- [ ] Develop testing strategy
- [ ] Setup initial CI/CD pipeline

## Known Issues & Challenges

| Issue | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| PDF Quality | Some papers may be scanned and require OCR | To be addressed |
| LLM Cost | API usage costs for commercial LLMs | Investigating alternatives |
| Context Limits | Large documents may exceed model context windows | Planning chunking strategy |

## Next Milestone

Developing a functioning proof-of-concept that can:
1. Extract text from a sample PDF paper
2. Process the text through an LLM to identify concepts
3. Store the concepts in a simple database
4. Allow basic querying of stored concepts
