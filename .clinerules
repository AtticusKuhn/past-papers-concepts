# Cline Rules: Past Paper Concept Analyzer

## Project Patterns & Preferences

### File Structure
- `pdfs/` directory for storing all source PDFs
- `extracted/` directory for storing extracted text
- `db/` directory for database files
- Main Python modules in project root
- Configuration in separate `.env` file (not committed to version control)

### Coding Style
- PEP 8 compliance for Python code
- Type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions
- Use of Python 3.10+ features where appropriate

### Processing Pipeline
- Each processing step should be implemented as a separate module
- Each module should be testable in isolation
- Components communicate through well-defined interfaces
- Error handling at each stage with appropriate logging

### Database
- SQLite for development, with option to switch to PostgreSQL
- Scripts for creating and updating schema
- Use of migrations for schema changes
- Clear documentation of schema design

### LLM Integration
- API keys stored in environment variables
- Parameterized prompts stored in configuration files
- Rate limiting to manage API costs
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures

### Testing
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for the pipeline
- Test fixtures for sample PDFs
- Mock LLM responses for testing

### Documentation
- README.md with setup and usage instructions
- Detailed architecture documentation
- Database schema documentation
- API documentation (if applicable)


### Running Commands
 - You are running on NixOs, and this project has its dependencies managed using nix-shell. If you want to run any commands, get into nix-shell before running that command.
